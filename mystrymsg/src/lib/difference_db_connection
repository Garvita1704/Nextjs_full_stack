when you make a pure backend appl
then once the appl starts and connects to the backend it keeps running and that's why we use cloud instances 
so that its running all the time
but nextjs is an edge time framework
and it only makes connnetions when demand is there
therfore db is not connnected always so we need to make a connection whenever a req arises 
if there are multiple concurrent requests at a time ten there is a chance that there exists a connection and therefore if we make multiple connections it might choke the appl and therefore w need to check before making a newe connection if there is an existing connection already then use that one oterwise make a  new one
